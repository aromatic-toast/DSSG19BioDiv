# GBIF and Rainbow List Comparison

The BC Red + Blue + Yellow list (the rainbow list) is assumed to represent most of the species that are currently present in British Columbia. According to the BC Ministry of Sustainable Resource Mangement, the Yellow list includes "common, declining and increasing species - all species not included on the Red and Blue lists". This implies that the BC rainbow list should be a reasonable approximation of most if not all the species that live in BC. It is of interest, to compare unique species on GBIF to the rainbow list species to investigate whether the rainbow list is a good reference for what occurs in BC. There is an expectation that a majority of the GBIF species names should be found on the rainbow list. The rainbow and GBIF species have the specific variety included in some of the species names. If both lists do not identify the same species to the same variety then the species names will not match even though in actuality the underlying species is the same between the two lists. The following comparisions have all been done with the var. removed from all species names.

### GBIF on Rainbow 
```{r}
# get the unique GBIF species names 
gbif_unique_names <- unique(trimmed_gbif$simplified_names)

# get the unique rainbow list species names 
rainbow_unique_names <- unique(rainbow_list$simplified_names)

# How many of the unique GBIF species are found on the rainbow list? 
gbif_rainbow_intersect <- sum(gbif_unique_names%in%rainbow_unique_names);num_gbif_on_rainbow
```

```{r}
# What percent of unique GBIF species are found on rainbow list? 
gbif_rainbow_intersect/length(gbif_unique_names)*100

# What percent of the rainbow list is found on GBIF?
gbif_rainbow_intersect/nrow(rainbow_list)*100
```
In addition to looking at the proportion of the rainbow list that is included on GBIF, one can also consider the proportion of the Red/Blue listed species alone that are found on GBIF. 
```{r}
# How many of GBIF unique species are found on bc_red_blue list?
num_gbif_on_redBlue <- sum(gbif_unique_names%in%bc_red_blue$simplified_names);num_gbif_on_redBlue

# What percent of unique GBIF species are found on bc_red_blue list? 
num_gbif_on_redBlue/length(gbif_unique_names)*100

# What percent of the bc_red_blue list species are found on GBIF?
num_gbif_on_redBlue/nrow(bc_red_blue)*100
```
### Summary 
The majority of GBIF species as a whole , ~ 75% are not found on the rainbow list. This top level comparison implies that the BC rainbow list does not represent most of the species in BC. 
When considering the Red/Blue list separately, ~ 20% of the Red/Blue species are found on GBIF. However, out of the GBIF species, ~ 2% are found on the Red/Blue list. 

### GBIF Plants on Rainbow
Breaking down the GBIF into its plant, animal and fungi parts could reveal which of these groups match the rainbow list the most. This could indicate where most of taxonomy incompatibilies lie, or indicate true gaps between rainbow and GBIF. 
```{r}
# Subset GBIF plants 
plants_gbif <- filter(trimmed_gbif, kingdom=="Plantae")


# get the unique plant names 
plants_gbif_unique_names <- unique(plants_gbif$simplified_names)
```

```{r}
# How many of the unique GBIF plant species are found on rainbow list?
gbif_plant_on_rainbow <- sum(plants_gbif_unique_names%in%rainbow_unique_names);gbif_plant_on_rainbow
```

```{r}
# What percent of GBIF plants are found on rainbow?
gbif_plant_on_rainbow/length(plants_gbif_unique_names)*100

```

```{r}
# What percent of GBIF as a whole are the plants found on rainbow?
gbif_plant_on_rainbow/length(na.omit(unique(trimmed_gbif$species)))*100

# What percent of rainbow are the plants found on GBIF?
gbif_plant_on_rainbow/nrow(rainbow_list)*100
```
### GBIF Animals on Rainbow
```{r}
# Subset the GBIF animals 
animal_gbif <- filter(trimmed_gbif, kingdom=="Animalia")

# Get unique animal names 
animal_gbif_unique_names <- unique(animal_gbif$simplified_names)
```

```{r}
# How many of the unique GBIF animal species are found on rainbow list?
gbif_animal_on_rainbow <- sum(animal_gbif_unique_names%in%rainbow_unique_names);gbif_animal_on_rainbow
```

```{r}
# What percent of GBIF animal are found on rainbow?
gbif_animal_on_rainbow/length(animal_gbif_unique_names)*100

```

```{r}
# Plants found on rainbow are what percent of GBIF species?
gbif_animal_on_rainbow/length(gbif_unique_names)*100

# What percent of the rainbow list are the animals found on GBIF
gbif_animal_on_rainbow/nrow(rainbow_list)*100
```

### GBIF Fungi on Rainbow
```{r}
# Subset the GBIF fungi 
fungi_gbif <- filter(trimmed_gbif, kingdom=="Fungi")

# Get the unqiue fungi names 
fungi_gbif_unique_names <- unique(fungi_gbif$simplified_names)
```

```{r}
# Unqiue fungi species are what percent of the GBIF unique species?
length(fungi_gbif_unique_names)/length(gbif_unique_names)*100
```


```{r}
# How many of the unique GBIF fungi species are found on rainbow list?
gbif_fungi_on_rainbow <- sum(na.omit(unique(fungi_gbif$species))%in%rainbow_list$Scientific.Name);gbif_fungi_on_rainbow
```

```{r}
# What percent of GBIF fungi are found on rainbow?
gbif_fungi_on_rainbow/length(na.omit(unique(fungi_gbif$species)))*100

```

```{r}
# Fungi found on rainbow are what percent of GBIF species?
gbif_fungi_on_rainbow/length(na.omit(unique(trimmed_gbif$species)))*100

# What percent of the rainbow list are the fungi species found on GBIF?
gbif_fungi_on_rainbow/nrow(rainbow_list)*100
```

# Conclusion: 
25% of GBIF is found on rainbow list. 
22% of the rainbow list is found on GBIF

Of the GBIF species found on rainbow list, 
~ 2% are fungi 
~ 10% are plants 
~ 12% are animals 

~ 20% of gbif plants are found on rainbow 
~ 44% of gbif animals are found on rainbow 
~ 12% of gbif fungi are found on rainbow 

```{r}
# With var. removed from both gbif and rainbow, how many of the unique GBIF species are found on rainbow list?
gbif_rainbow_intersect <- sum(na.omit(unique(trimmed_gbif$simplified_names))%in%unique(rainbow_list$simplified_names));gbif_rainbow_intersect

# How many additional species does this allow to match?
num_gbif_on_rainbow-sum(unique(trimmed_gbif$species)%in%rainbow_list$Scientific.Name)
```

# Rainbow List and IUCN Comparison 
```{r}
# How many species on bc_red_blue list are on the IUCN?
bc_red_blue_on_IUCN <- sum(unique(bc_red_blue$simplified_names)%in%unique(IUCN_list$simplified_names));bc_red_blue_on_IUCN

# What percent of the BC_red_blue list are on IUCN?
bc_red_blue_on_IUCN/length(unique(bc_red_blue$simplified_names))*100
```
Summary: There is not much overlap between the BC Red/Blue list and the IUCN red list. Only 3.5% of the BC Red/Blue list is found on the IUCN. 

# GBIF and IUCN Comparison

# How many of the IUCN red list species are found on GBIF?

# what percent of the IUCN list is found on gbif

# What percent of the GBIF is found on IUCN?
